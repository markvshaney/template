To start a new branch from a commit that's a few commits back while preserving your most recent commits, here's the best systematic approach:

1. First, identify the specific commit hash you want to branch from:

   - Use the Git history viewer in VS Code or run `git log` in terminal
   - Copy the commit hash (or first 7+ characters) of your target commit

2. Create a new branch from that specific commit:

   - From your Image 2, select "Create Branch From..."
   - In the dropdown that appears, choose "Specific commit"
   - Enter the commit hash you identified
   - Name your new branch meaningfully (e.g., "feature/add-authentication")

3. To preserve your current work and latest commits:

   - Before switching to the new branch, ensure your current branch is fully committed
   - Your original branch will remain untouched with all commits intact

4. To switch between branches:

   - Use the branch selector in the bottom-left corner of VS Code
   - Or use "Branch > Checkout to..." from your Git menu

5. To retrieve files from your more recent commits when needed:
   - Switch back to your original branch
   - Copy the files you need
   - Return to your new branch and paste them

This approach gives you a clean new starting point while ensuring your recent work remains accessible whenever needed.
