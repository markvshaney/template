# Step 6: Implement Web Search, RAG, and Ollama Integration - Complete Summary

## Overview

This step implemented the core functionality for web search with Brave Search, content extraction using Firecrawl, document processing for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), and integration with local Ollama models. The implementation provides a solid foundation for searching the web, extracting content, and leveraging local AI models to enhance search capabilities.

## Original Checklist Step
