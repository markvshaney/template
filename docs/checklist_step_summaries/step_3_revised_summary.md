# Step 3 Revised: Document-Centric Database Schema Implementation

## Original Checklist Step

Step 3 initially focused on implementing a basic memory system with a PostgreSQL database and Prisma ORM. The original implementation supported memory creation, retrieval, and a simple consolidation mechanism using a vector database for embedding storage.

## Revision Purpose

The project has been redirected to focus on web search and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) while maintaining backward compatibility with existing memory functionality. This revision implements a document-centric approach to better support:

- Document storage and chunking
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Web search history tracking
- Integration with external AI services

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Document-Centric Database Schema

- Added new Prisma models: `Document`, `Chunk`, `SearchQuery`, and `SearchResult`
- Implemented relationships between models for coherent data flow
- Maintained compatibility with existing `Memory` and `Session` models

### 2. Database Utility Functions

- Created functions for document management (creation, retrieval, deletion)
- Implemented chunking functionality for document processing
- Added vector similarity search capabilities
- Developed search history tracking functions
- Maintained backward compatibility with memory-based functions

### 3. Vector Utilities

- Implemented vector operations for embedding manipulation
- Added cosine similarity calculation for semantic search
- Created utility functions for vector normalization and distance calculation

## Technical Decisions

| Decision                  | Rationale                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Document-centric schema   | Better alignment with RAG architecture and web search functionality     |
| Maintaining legacy models | Ensures backward compatibility with existing code                       |
| Chunking approach         | Enables fine-grained semantic search over document content              |
| Vector embedding field    | Enables similarity search using PostgreSQL vector operations            |
| JSON metadata fields      | Provides flexibility for storing various document and search attributes |

## Files Created or Modified

- `prisma/schema.prisma`: Updated schema with new document and search models
- `src/lib/db.ts`: Added document, chunk, and search history functions
- `src/lib/vector.ts`: Created new utility file for vector operations
- `src/lib/db.test.ts`: Updated tests for document and search functionality
- `__mocks__/@prisma/client.js`: Extended Prisma mock for testing

## Implementation Notes

### Schema Design

The revised schema introduces a hierarchical structure:

- Documents contain multiple chunks
- Each chunk stores embedding vectors and keywords
- Search queries link to multiple search results
- Users relate to documents, memories, and search queries

All models include metadata fields for extensibility, allowing additional attributes to be stored without schema changes.

### Vector Operations

The implementation uses a sophisticated vector similarity search approach:

- Cosine similarity for finding related chunks/documents
- PostgreSQL vector operations for efficient database-level similarity calculations
- Support for hybrid search using both vector similarities and keyword matching

### Backward Compatibility

The revision maintains all original memory functionality while adding new document capabilities:

- Legacy memory creation and retrieval functions remain unchanged
- Memory consolidation still works with the existing schema
- Session management is preserved
- Vector operations support both new and old models

## Verification Status

- ✅ Database schema successfully updated with document-centric models
- ✅ Utility functions implemented for document and chunk management
- ✅ Vector operations implemented for similarity search
- ✅ Tests created for new document-centric functionality
- ✅ Backward compatibility confirmed with existing memory functions

## Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge                          | Solution                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Type conflicts with Prisma client  | Created custom typings for document models             |
| Vector embedding storage           | Used Postgres vector operations with type assertions   |
| Maintaining backward compatibility | Preserved all existing functions while adding new ones |
| Mock implementation for tests      | Extended Prisma client mock with document models       |

## Future Improvements

- Implement a more efficient vector database solution (e.g., pgvector extension)
- Add document preprocessing pipeline for better chunking
- Implement batch operations for document and chunk creation
- Optimize similarity search for large document collections
- Add document versioning for tracking changes over time
