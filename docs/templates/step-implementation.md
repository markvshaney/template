# Step X Implementation Template

## 1. Planning Phase

- [ ] Review requirements

  - Read the task description and plan in the checklist
  - Understand the purpose and expected outcomes
  - Identify dependencies on other components
  - Note any technical constraints or requirements

- [ ] Research and Design

  - Research best practices for the specific task
  - Explore existing solutions and approaches
  - Create a high-level design for the implementation
  - Document design decisions and trade-offs

- [ ] Create Detailed Implementation Plan
  - Break down the task into smaller, manageable subtasks
  - Estimate time requirements for each subtask
  - Identify potential challenges and mitigation strategies
  - Prepare a list of files to be created or modified

## 2. Implementation Phase

- [ ] Set up development environment

  - Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed
  - Create feature branch with descriptive name
  - Set up any required local configurations

- [ ] Implement core functionality

  - Follow the implementation plan created earlier
  - Adhere to project coding standards and best practices
  - Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
  - Commit changes frequently with descriptive commit messages

- [ ] Add tests

  - Write unit tests for individual components
  - Create integration tests for component interactions
  - Implement end-to-end tests for user workflows
  - Ensure test coverage meets project standards

- [ ] Update documentation
  - Add JSDoc comments to all functions, classes, and interfaces
  - Update README or other documentation files as needed
  - Document any non-obvious implementation details
  - Create usage examples if appropriate

## 3. Verification Phase

- [ ] Run code quality checks

  - Run linters and formatters (ESLint, Prettier)
  - Address all warnings and errors
  - Ensure code follows project style guidelines
  - Perform static analysis if applicable

- [ ] Verify test coverage

  - Run all tests to ensure they pass
  - Verify test coverage meets requirements
  - Perform manual testing for UI components
  - Test edge cases and error handling

- [ ] Review performance
  - Check for performance bottlenecks
  - Optimize resource usage where necessary
  - Ensure proper error handling and input validation

## 4. Completion Phase

- [ ] Create merged summary

  - Create a single comprehensive summary document
  - Combine the AI-enhanced plan and implementation details
  - Include all required sections as specified in Documentation Standards
  - Save in `docs/checklist_step_summaries/` directory

- [ ] Update checklist

  - Mark the step as complete in the checklist
  - Add any notes or observations
  - Document any issues or concerns

- [ ] Create pull request

  - Title: "Step X: Description"
  - Description: Link to step summary and plan
  - Labels: step-X, needs-review

- [ ] Get approval

  - Address any feedback
  - Make necessary changes
  - Get final approval

- [ ] Merge changes
  - Merge after approval
  - Clean up branch
  - Update documentation if needed
