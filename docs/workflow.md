# Project Workflow Guide

This document outlines the standardized workflow for completing steps in the project checklist. Following this workflow ensures consistency, quality, and proper documentation throughout the development process.

## Step Completion Workflow

### A. Planning Phase

1. **Review the Step Requirements**
   - Read the task description and plan in the checklist
   - Understand the purpose and expected outcomes
   - Identify dependencies on other components
   - Note any technical constraints or requirements

2. **Research and Design**
   - Research best practices for the specific task
   - Explore existing solutions and approaches
   - Create a high-level design for the implementation
   - Document design decisions and trade-offs

3. **Create Detailed Implementation Plan**
   - Break down the task into smaller, manageable subtasks
   - Estimate time requirements for each subtask
   - Identify potential challenges and mitigation strategies
   - Prepare a list of files to be created or modified


### B. Approval Phase

4.  - Write the plan, entitled "Step x AI-enhanced plan" and present for approval
   - WAIT!! DO NOT PROCEED FURTHER!!! ASK "implement plan? y/n" if no, terminate   
  workflow. if yes, proceed to implemenation Phase




### C. Implementation Phase

5. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed
   - Create feature branch with descriptive name (e.g., `feature/step-X-component-name`)
   - Set up any required local configurations

6. **Implement Core Functionality**
   - Follow the implementation plan created earlier
   - Adhere to project coding standards and best practices
   - Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
   - Commit changes frequently with descriptive commit messages

7. **Add Comprehensive Tests**
   - Write unit tests for individual components
   - Create integration tests for component interactions
   - Implement end-to-end tests for user workflows (if applicable)
   - Ensure test coverage meets project standards

8. **Documentation**
   - Add JSDoc comments to all functions, classes, and interfaces
   - Update README or other documentation files as needed
   - Document any non-obvious implementation details
   - Create usage examples if appropriate

### D. Verification Phase

9. **Code Quality Checks**
   - Run linters and formatters (ESLint, Prettier)
   - Address all warnings and errors
   - Ensure code follows project style guidelines
   - Perform static analysis if applicable

10. **Testing**
   - Run all tests to ensure they pass
   - Verify test coverage meets requirements
   - Perform manual testing for UI components
   - Test edge cases and error handling

11. **Performance and Security Review**
    - Check for performance bottlenecks
    - Optimize resource usage where necessary
    - Ensure proper error handling and input validation

### E. Completion Phase

12. **Final Review**
    - Conduct a self-review of all changes
    - Ensure all requirements have been met
    - Verify that documentation is complete and accurate
    - Check that all tests are passing

13. **Implementation Summary**
    - Create a summary document (`step_X_project_summary.md`)
    - Document original checklist steps instructions
    - Document AI-enhanced plan
    - Document what was implemented
    - List all files created or modified
    - Note any deviations from the original plan and why
    - Include verification results
    - Document any known limitations or future improvements

14. **Save Summary
    - Save step summary in docs/checklist_step_summaries

15. **Mark as Complete**
    - Update the checklist to mark the step as complete

16. **Prompt for Git Commit
    - Ask "Git Commit? y/n"
    - If yes, follow Git_Protocol.md



## Documentation Standards

### Implementation Summary Structure

Each implementation summary (`step_X_project_summary.md`) should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Step X: [Step Title]

## Overview
Brief description of the step and its purpose in the project.

## Checklist Step
Original checklist step

## AI-Enhanced Plan
AI-Enhanced plan

## Implementation Details
Detailed explanation of what was implemented, including:
- Key components and their functionality
- Design patterns or architectural approaches used
- Dependencies on other components
- Technical decisions and trade-offs

## Files Created/Modified
- `path/to/file1.ts`: Description of changes or purpose
- `path/to/file2.ts`: Description of changes or purpose

## Verification
- Test results and coverage metrics
- Performance benchmarks (if applicable)
- Validation against requirements

## Challenges and Solutions
Any significant challenges encountered and how they were addressed.

## Future Improvements
Potential enhancements or optimizations for future iterations.
```

## Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the project's ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use double quotes for strings
- Prefer template literals for string concatenation
- Use 2-space indentation
- Use async/await over Promise chains
- Write JSDoc headers for all public functions and classes
- Include inline comments for complex logic
- Document parameters, return types, and potential side effects

## Testing Standards

- Aim for at least 80% test coverage for new code
- Write unit tests for individual functions and components
- Create integration tests for interactions between components
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test structure
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test both success and failure scenarios

## Error Handling

- Validate input data at system boundaries
- Use try-catch blocks for operations that may fail
- Provide descriptive error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Implement graceful degradation where possible

By following this workflow consistently, we ensure that all project steps are completed to a high standard, with proper documentation and testing.
