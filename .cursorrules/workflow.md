## Step 3: Set Up Code Quality Tools

### Overview

This step establishes a robust code quality infrastructure to ensure consistent development practices, automated quality checks, and maintainable codebase standards.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Dependencies Setup**

   - ESLint with TypeScript, React, and a11y plugins
   - Prettier for code formatting
   - Husky for Git hooks
   - Lint-staged for efficient linting
   - Commitlint for commit message validation
   - Jest for testing

2. **Configuration Files**

   - ESLint configuration with project-specific rules
   - Prettier settings for consistent formatting
   - Husky hooks for pre-commit and commit-msg
   - Lint-staged configuration for optimized linting
   - Jest setup with TypeScript support
   - VS Code settings and extensions

3. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive CODE_QUALITY.md
   - Usage guidelines and examples
   - Troubleshooting guide

### Implementation Recap

1. **Code Quality Tools**

   - ✓ ESLint configured with TypeScript, React, and a11y support
   - ✓ Prettier set up with project-specific formatting rules

   - React best practices are followed

2. **Git Workflow**

   - Pre-commit hooks prevent bad commits
   - Commit messages follow conventional commits
   - Only changed files are linted
   - Pre-push checks ensure code quality

3. **IDE Integration**
   - VS Code settings provide consistent experience
   - Format on save works correctly
   - ESLint fixes are applied automatically
   - TypeScript support is fully functional

### Success Criteria

1. All code quality tools are properly installed and configured
2. Git hooks are working as expected
3. VS Code integration is functioning
4. Commit message validation is active
5. Testing infrastructure is ready for use
6. Documentation is comprehensive and clear

### Next Steps

- Begin implementing unit tests
- Set up integration testing
- Configure end-to-end testing
- Establish continuous integration pipeline

## Step Summary Files

Each step in the development process should have a corresponding summary file in the `docs/checklist_step_summaries` directory. The naming convention for these files is:

```
step_X_project_summary.md
```

where X is the step number. For example:

- step_1_project_summary.md
- step_2_project_summary.md
- step_3_project_summary.md

Each summary file should contain:

1. Overview of the step
2. Implementation plan
3. Implementation recap
4. Verification steps
5. Success criteria
6. Next steps
