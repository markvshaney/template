   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Initialize database:
   ```bash
   npm run prisma:generate
   npm run prisma:push
   ```

## Development Process

### Feature Development
1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name
   ```
2. Follow the checklist in `checklist.md`
3. Implement changes following coding standards
4. Write tests for new functionality
5. Update documentation
6. Create pull request

### Code Review Process
1. Self-review changes
2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
3. Check code quality:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run format
   ```
4. Submit for review
5. Address feedback
6. Merge after approval

## Checklist Step Completion

### A. Planning Phase
1. **Review the Step Requirements**
   - Read the task description and plan in the checklist
   - Understand the purpose and expected outcomes
   - Identify dependencies on other components
   - Note any technical constraints or requirements

2. **Research and Design**
   - Research best practices for the specific task
   - Explore existing solutions and approaches
   - Create a high-level design for the implementation
   - Document design decisions and trade-offs

3. **Create Detailed Implementation Plan**
   - Break down the task into smaller, manageable subtasks
   - Estimate time requirements for each subtask
   - Identify potential challenges and mitigation strategies
   - Prepare a list of files to be created or modified

### B. Approval Phase
4. **Create and Present AI-Enhanced Plan**
   - Write the plan, entitled "Step x AI-enhanced plan"
   - Present for approval
   - WAIT!! DO NOT PROCEED FURTHER!!!
   - Ask "implement plan? y/n"
   - If no, terminate workflow
   - If yes, proceed to Implementation Phase

### C. Implementation Phase
5. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed
   - Create feature branch with descriptive name
   - Set up any required local configurations

6. **Implement Core Functionality**
   - Follow the implementation plan created earlier
   - Adhere to project coding standards and best practices
   - Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
   - Commit changes frequently with descriptive commit messages

7. **Add Comprehensive Tests**
   - Write unit tests for individual components
   - Create integration tests for component interactions
   - Implement end-to-end tests for user workflows
   - Ensure test coverage meets project standards

8. **Documentation**
   - Add JSDoc comments to all functions, classes, and interfaces
   - Update README or other documentation files as needed
   - Document any non-obvious implementation details
   - Create usage examples if appropriate

### D. Verification Phase
9. **Code Quality Checks**
   - Run linters and formatters (ESLint, Prettier)
   - Address all warnings and errors
   - Ensure code follows project style guidelines
   - Perform static analysis if applicable

10. **Testing**
    - Run all tests to ensure they pass
    - Verify test coverage meets requirements
    - Perform manual testing for UI components
    - Test edge cases and error handling

11. **Performance and Security Review**
    - Check for performance bottlenecks
    - Optimize resource usage where necessary
    - Ensure proper error handling and input validation

### E. Completion Phase
12. **Final Review**
    - Conduct a self-review of all changes
    - Ensure all requirements have been met
    - Verify that documentation is complete and accurate
    - Check that all tests are passing

13. **Create Merged Summary**
    - Create a single comprehensive summary document (`step_X_summary.md`)
    - Combine the AI-enhanced plan and implementation details
    - Include all required sections as specified in Documentation Standards
    - Save in `docs/checklist_step_summaries/` directory

14. **Mark as Complete**
    - Update the checklist to mark the step as complete

15. **Git Commit**
    - Ask "Git Commit? y/n"
    - If yes, follow Git_Protocol.md
