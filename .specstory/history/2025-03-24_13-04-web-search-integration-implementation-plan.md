I'll review the workflow documentation and checklist to create a detailed implementation plan for Step 11: Web Search Integration.

## Step 11: Web Search Integration - Implementation Plan

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Implement a web search API client to fetch search results from external sources
- Create result processing utilities to filter and format search results
- Implement caching mechanism for search results
- Define type definitions for search-related operations
- Build comprehensive test suite

### 2. File Structure
- `src/lib/search/web-search.ts`: API client for web search providers
- `src/lib/search/result-processor.ts`: Utilities for filtering and processing results
- `src/lib/search/types.ts`: TypeScript interfaces and types
- `__tests__/lib/search/web-search.test.ts`: Tests for web search functionality

### 3. Detailed Implementation Tasks

#### 3.1 Core Search Client (`src/lib/search/web-search.ts`)
- Create modular client supporting multiple search providers
- Implement error handling and retry logic
- Add request rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- Create search configuration options (results count, safe search, etc.)
- Integrate with database caching system from Step 9

#### 3.2 Result Processing (`src/lib/search/result-processor.ts`)
- Implement content extraction from search results
- Create result filtering based on relevance
- Implement result normalization to standardized format
- Add metadata enrichment for search results
- Create utility for merging results from multiple providers

#### 3.3 Type Definitions (`src/lib/search/types.ts`)
- Define interfaces for search queries and parameters
- Create types for raw and processed search results
- Define provider-specific configuration types
- Implement type guards for validation

#### 3.4 Testing (`__tests__/lib/search/web-search.test.ts`)
- Test successful search operations
- Test error handling and retries
- Mock HTTP responses for reliable testing
- Test result processing and filtering
- Verify caching functionality

### 4. Integration Points
- Connect with search history schema from Step 9
- Utilize caching system to reduce API calls
- Prepare for integration with RAG system in Step 13

### 5. Technical Decisions
- Use fetch API for HTTP requests
- Implement provider-specific adapters for different search engines
- Use environment variables for API keys and configuration
- Implement request queuing for rate-limited APIs
- Add telemetry for monitoring search performance

### 6. Verification Strategy
- Verify proper error handling
- Test with different query types and parameters
- Confirm result processing maintains data integrity
- Ensure type safety throughout implementation
- Validate performance with larger result sets
